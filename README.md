# Autonomous-Xylophone Robot
Code created by Trevor Gallant, Stephanie Skarica, and Elizabeth Drew
The final code used to autonomously play music on an xylophone using RobotC code, a Lego Mindstorm Kit, and .text files.
This was the code used in a 1A University of Waterloo Mechatronics end of term project. The project was to design, construct, 
and code a robot with an autonomous task using RobotC and a Lego Mindstorm Kit. This is the final code that was used to 
successfully achieve the goal of the robot, to read notes from a .text file and play the corresponding notes on a xylophone. 
The theme of the project was Christmas. Therefore, the code was used to play Christmas carols. Additionally, the code features 
an additional function that detects for Santa Claus flying above and delivering presents using an ultrasonic sensor and touch sensor.
